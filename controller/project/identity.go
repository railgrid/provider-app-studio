// Per-project ServiceAccount identity.
//
// Repository commits and instance lifecycling run in this controller, long
// after the request that caused them — so they cannot borrow the editing
// user's bearer (request-scoped, and the same trap the agents provider hit).
// Instead each project gets its own ServiceAccount in the tenant workspace;
// the controller uses its token for hub MCP calls AND as the identity behind
// the tenant-path client that lifecycles instances/repositories. That client
// goes through the workspace's own bindings, so it reaches whichever copy of
// the infrastructure/code provider the workspace binds — platform or
// self-hosted — with no permission-claim identity pinning involved (see
// package tenantaccess).
//
// SCOPE, STATED PLAINLY: this token can manage the workspace's infrastructure
// instances and read/write its code resources, it does not expire, and
// revoking it means deleting the ServiceAccount — which happens
// automatically, because the objects are owned by the Project and
// garbage-collected with it.
